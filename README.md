# Early Flash Projects

These are some of the Flash (.fla) files I created during my elementary school days. They showcase my early interest in animation and interactive design, which laid the foundation for my passion in software development.

## Projects Included
- **Jumping Game (2008)**: A simple game where a character jumps over obstacles.
- **Interactive Story (2009)**: A branching story with basic animations and user choices.
- **Music Visualizer (2010)**: A visual animation synchronized with sound effects.

## Features
- Early use of ActionScript for interactivity.
- Basic character animations and transitions.
- User input for navigating the stories.

## Technical Background
- Created using Adobe Flash CS3.
- Utilized ActionScript 2.0 for scripting.
- Focused on timeline-based animations and basic interactivity.

## Lessons Learned
- Developed an early interest in programming and animation.
- Learned the basics of scripting logic and debugging.
- Gained an appreciation for interactive design.

## How to Run
- These files are in `.fla` format and require Adobe Flash CS3 or higher to open.
- Due to Flash support being discontinued, you can use the **Adobe Flash Player Projector** or other emulation tools like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).

## Archival Purpose
These files represent my early experiments with animation and game development. They serve as a reflection of my growth as a developer and my continuous passion for creating interactive experiences.
